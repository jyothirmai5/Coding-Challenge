I have integrated backend API calls to use GET and POST methods

Step 1: Open the Project folder
Step 2: `npm install` after successful installation of packages
Step 3: Run `node contactFormApi` to start the backend server
Step 4: Open index.html or you can click Go Live option in VS code to run the frontend code
